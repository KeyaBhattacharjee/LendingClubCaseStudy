## General Information
- A consumer finance company  specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. 
- When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. There are two types of risks involved - business loss and financial or credit loss. If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios - Fully paid, current and charged off (who are the defaulters)
- Our objective is to identify the risky applicants using EDA 
- The dataset we are using is the list of candidates whose loans have been accepted and fall under any of the three categories - Fully paid, current and charged off
